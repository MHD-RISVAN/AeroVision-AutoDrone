# Project Autonomus Drone 🛸

## 📍 Overview
This is my autonomous drone project. I am building this because I love aviation and want to see how code can control a physical flying machine without a pilot.

## 🛠️ The Goal
My goal is to build a quadcopter that can:
1. Hover and stabilize itself using an IMU sensor.
2. Navigate between points using GPS coordinates.
3. Send live flight data to my "AeroVerse" web platform.

## 📦 Initial Parts List (BOM)
| Component | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Flight Controller** | ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Pico |
| **Motors** | 4x Brushless Motors (A2212) |
| **ESC** | 4x 30A Electronic Speed Controllers |
| **Frame** | Custom Foamboard or Carbon Fiber |
| **Sensors** | MPU6050 (Gyro) + NEO-6M (GPS) |

## 🚀 Status
- [x] Initial design concept.
- [ ] Ordering parts from Robu.in.
- [ ] Drawing the wiring diagram.
- [ ] Writing the stabilization code.

*Note: I am using my 8-month Aerospace course knowledge from IIT Madras to calculate the lift and thrust ratios for this build.*
