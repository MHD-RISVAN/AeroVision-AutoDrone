# Project Autonomus Drone 🛸

## 📍 Overview
This is my autonomous drone project. I am building this because I love aviation and want to see how code can control a physical flying machine without a pilot.

## 🛠️ The Goal (i don't know, is it possible or not just started) 📈
My goal is to build a quadcopter that can: ✈️
1. Hover and stabilize itself using an IMU sensor.
2. Navigate between points using GPS coordinates.
3. Send live flight data to my "AeroVerse" web platform.

*Note: I am using my 8-month Aerospace course knowledge from IIT Madras to calculate the lift and thrust ratios for this build.*
